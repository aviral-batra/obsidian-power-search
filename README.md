# Obsidian Power Search

## TODO 

- add search query history to undo search history
- search blocks vs line option 
- sources other than anki (allow registering "sources" through api)
- allow index and search customisation
- highlight words that are part of the search
- have stripped and highlighted section as toggle and then the original html as the expand content under the toggle
- allow typos?
- Allow selection of search results themselves to search for more notes (see other siac functionality)
- fix image error console and in cards
- make general index creator accessible by api to allow others to add their own searchable content to the index
- anki css for notes (override plugin css? + make this an option?)
- use svelte components?
- integration with obsidian to anki? i.e. find the note using the id (not necessary due to obsidian link?)
- refresh index command? + option to not debounced refresh index on each search 
- render maths eqns
